# adyen-test

Hello All,
Thank you for visiting this repository to view my take home test code.

Web application using OMDB API.
Please find below few points, i think worth mentioning.

1) To run, please download the files using code(download button). Unzip the archive and run index.html file in any browser.
2) You can also view the same on my portfolio website having URL - http://namsharma.com/adyen-test/
3) I Haven't used any JS framework (Grunt or Angular) for this app as it is a small app, so used own project structure. 
4) Used Flex display for most of the elements, though the same can be achived with other approaches as well.
5) Details like Movie title, Movie Poster, Rating and Cast are show in search results where as the Plot details for the movie can be seen/hidden after clicking details link. 
6) I have spent around 4 - 5 hours including all the UX, UI and deployment work.


Please feel free to contact or
